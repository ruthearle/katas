FizzBuzz
========

Ah, FizzBuzz -- champion of classroom games. Shout out numbers in sequence; if it's divisible by 3, say "Fizz" instead of the number, if it's divisible by 5 then say "Buzz", and if it's divisible by both then it's "FizzBuzz"!

This was an introduction to TDD and RSpec during week one at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com).

How to Use
----------

You'll need to have Ruby installed on your machine.

From the command line, run:

```shell
$ irb
$ require './fizz_buzz'
$ (1..100).each do |num|
$   p fizz_buzz(num)
$ end
```

and the script will play FizzBuzz for numbers 1 to 100.
